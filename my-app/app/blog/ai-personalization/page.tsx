  You must adapt your teaching style based on the student's level:
  - Levels 1‚Äì2: Use simple, playful language and visual metaphors.
  - Levels 3‚Äì5: Introduce grade-appropriate math terms and encourage reasoning.
  - Levels 6‚Äì8: Use real-world logic scenarios and mental math.
  - Levels 9‚Äì12: Prioritize strategic thinking and formal math vocabulary.

  ### Rules for Answering Student Questions
  1. For fewer than 3 attempts:
    - NEVER reveal the final answer.
    - NEVER say full equations like "4 x 4 = 16".
    - Use a ‚ùì or blank and end with a guiding question.
  2. After 3 or more failed attempts:
    - You may walk through the solution step-by-step.
    - Ask what the student found tricky before explaining.
    - Begin any correct answer with "Correct!"

  You are teaching students to think, not to watch.
  Never give answers directly unless they‚Äôve failed multiple times.

        How I'm Personalizing AI Tutoring Based on Skill, Age, and Attempts
      </motion.h1>
      <p className="text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-300 mb-6 text-sm">

        <span className="italic">AI, Personalization, EdTech</span>
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200">
        One of the most powerful upgrades to my AIcademy app was introducing
        <strong> dynamic personalization</strong> for every student based on
        their age, grade, subject, XP, and how many attempts they've made on a
        given challenge.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200">
        By integrating Supabase Auth, I can retrieve a student‚Äôs profile and
        tailor the tone, complexity, and teaching strategy in real-time.
        Combined with challenge attempt tracking, the AI evolves its tutoring
        behavior the longer a student works on a problem.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        üß† Dynamic Prompt Behavior
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200">
        I built logic that changes how the AI responds based on how many times
        the student has tried a problem. Here‚Äôs a core snippet of that logic:
      </p>

      <div className="mb-6 rounded-md overflow-hidden">
        <SyntaxHighlighter language="tsx" style={oneDark} wrapLongLines>
          {behaviorSnippet}
        </SyntaxHighlighter>
      </div>

      <p className="mb-4 text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200">
        The AI is encouraged to ask guiding questions on early attempts rather
        than give away answers. Only after multiple tries does it gradually
        explain more ‚Äî a method inspired by real tutoring strategies.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        üìò Age and Grade-Based Responses
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200">
        I also wrote detailed instruction layers based on the student's level.
        For example:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200 mb-4">
        <li>
          Younger students (ages 5‚Äì8) get visual metaphors like ‚Äú4 baskets of
          apples.‚Äù
        </li>
        <li>
          Middle schoolers are given real-world scenarios like shopping or time
          travel.
        </li>
        <li>
          High schoolers get concise prompts like ‚ÄúProve,‚Äù ‚ÄúDerive,‚Äù or
          ‚ÄúJustify.‚Äù
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4 text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200">
        This approach lets the AI tutor feel natural to each student ‚Äî not just
        accurate, but human and age-appropriate.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200">
        This system prompt logic is one of the most complex parts of the app,
        but it‚Äôs also what brings the experience to life. Rather than a
        one-size-fits-all model, students get a tutor that grows with them.
