      <p className="mb-4 text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200">
        When I first started this project, the goal was simple: create an{" "}
        <strong>AI chatbot that helps students think deeper</strong>. It would
        ask better questions, avoid spoon-feeding answers, and encourage
        students to reflect before solving. That foundation is still there ‚Äî but
        the vision has evolved.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200">
        Over the past few weeks, I've pivoted from just building an AI assistant
        into building an{" "}
        <strong>entire teacher-powered learning ecosystem</strong>. The AI is no
        longer the sole experience ‚Äî it's now one piece of a broader platform
        that enables teachers to create and manage structured learning content.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        üßë‚Äçüè´ Teacher-Driven Content Creation
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200">
        Teachers can now create classrooms, invite students (or let them join
        via code), and build full learning modules. Each module contains
        lesson(s) and associated quizzes ‚Äî all tied to a real class structure.
        This gives educators full control over how content is delivered and who
        it's assigned to.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200">
        I've almost completed the full class setup and module workflow,
        including:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200 mb-4">
        <li>Creating and managing class groups</li>
        <li>Assigning students manually or via join codes</li>
        <li>Uploading or writing lessons directly into the platform</li>
        <li>Adding quizzes that test student understanding</li>
        <li>Assigning modules to specific classes or individuals</li>
      </ul>

      <div className="my-6">
        <img
          src="/student_dashboard.png"
          alt="Student Dashboard Preview"
          className="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full"
        />
        <p className="text-sm text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400 mt-2 text-center">
          A sneak peek at the redesigned student dashboard with class modules,
          lesson access, and progress tracking.

      </div>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        üß† The AI Assistant‚Äôs Role Has Shifted
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200">
        The AI assistant is still here ‚Äî but now it serves as a{" "}
        <strong>personalized companion within a larger learning journey</strong>
        . Instead of just answering open-ended prompts, it will help students by
        summarizing lessons, guiding them through quiz questions, and nudging
        them toward discovery ‚Äî not shortcuts.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200">
        The goal is not to make an answer machine, but a tutor that challenges
        students to <em>think</em>. When implemented, the AI will adapt its
        responses depending on quiz attempts, offering increasing guidance only
        after a student struggles. It's teaching through struggle, not bypassing
        it.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">üöß What‚Äôs Coming Next</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200">
        The final piece I'm working on is the AI-powered quiz assistant. Soon,
        students will be able to attempt quiz questions with the help of our AI
        ‚Äî which will know when to hint, when to ask questions, and when to step
        back. Think of it as a learning coach embedded directly into every
        assessment.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200">
        With this structure in place, EduAI is becoming more than a tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs
        shaping into a true learning environment where{" "}
        <strong>AI augments teaching</strong>, not replaces it.
